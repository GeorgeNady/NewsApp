// that is a class recommended by Google to be used to wrap around our network responses
// and that will be a generic class
// and its very useful to differentiate between successful and error responses
    // and also help us to handel the loading state =>
        // so when we make a response we can show a progress bar while that response is processing
        // and when we get the answer then we can use this class to tell us whether that answer was successful or an error
        // and depending on that we can handel that error or show that successful response


// sealed : it is kind of abstract class
// but we can define which classes are allowed to inherit from that Resource class
sealed class Resource<T>(
    val data: T? = null,
    val message: String? = null
) {

    // in here we will define three different classes
    // and only those are allowed to inherit from Resource class

    class Success<T>(data: T) : Resource<T>(data)
    class Error<T>(message: String,data: T? = null) : Resource<T>(data , message)
